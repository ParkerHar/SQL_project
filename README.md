# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals

>Create a new database for a small e-commerce business and provide analytics based on their supplied data
>


## Process

>Created Postgres Database 'ecommmerce' and loaded data from [these 5 files](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1efDA4oc9w-bTbAvrESdOJpg9u-gEUBhJ)
>

>Systematically reviewed each table to gain a better understanding of the dataset. Took some steps to clean the tables (see cleaning_data) and determined which tables contained the required information to perform analysis.
>

>Worked through the supplied questions to provide best possible answers. While playing with the data I came up with three of my own questions as well (see starting_with_data)
>

## Results
>A new ecommerce database was created that can be used to perform a wide variety of analysis for this business. The database contains five separate tables. Four of the tables are joined together with the primary key 'sku' from the 'products' table. 
>

## Challenges 
>Many of the supplied data files contained multiple duplicate rows, null columns or overall ambiguous column names. This made performing confident analysis difficult and resulted in inaccurate or skewed answers to analytical questions (see starting_with_questions). 
>

## Future Goals
>I would like to dig deeper on how to break down sales data by country and city in a more efficient manner. This may require gathering new data or going back to the client for different data to load into the database.
